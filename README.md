A colour based 2d Platformer. You play as a character that can change between black and white, passing through objects of the same colour and colliding with objects of the same colour. The goal is to reach the level exit portal but be careful of environmental hazards such as colour changing platforms or turrets that can alter the colour of anything they hit.
